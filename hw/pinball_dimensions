AI calculations:

Component	Dimension (inches)	Reasoning
Playfield Size	15" × 24"	Your specified dimensions
Cabinet Width	~17"	Adds ~1" clearance on each side for rails and wall thickness
Cabinet Depth	~26"–27"	24" playfield + ~2–3" for apron and front panel
Front Height	~9.5"	Scaled down from full-size (~15") using width ratio ≈ 0.63
Back Height	~15"	Maintains slope ratio of ~0.625 for good ball flow
Playfield Slope	~6.5° recommended	Standard slope for visibility and gameplay feel
Glass Cover Size	~15" × 24"	Matches playfield, with slight overhang for framing

Backbase size: 12x12x6 - this is a little smaller than typical backbase 1/2 scale, but should fit on the machine ok

This smee a bit too tall right now, maybe shorter... depends on how things fit..
Bottom Base Back Height: ~12" 
Bottom Base Front Height: ~8"
