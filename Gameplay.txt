Current ideas for the gameplay - subject to change

Left Ramp: Tomb - gold and 30s ball save / ressurection
Rigtht Ramp: Ruins - +1 sword power (up to 20) - gold
Left back path: Trail to town - either to town or to Inn (diverter?)
Top Lanes: I-N-N, opens the Inn to hire compaions (lock ball) - limited time opening.  Town theme in upper right corner
If you have enough gold, can hire party member: Wizard, Rogue, Ranger, if not, ball is kicked out
Dark Forest Pop Bumpers - build up gold
Right 3 targets: K-E-Y - open door to dungeon - a chance to enter
Enter dungeon - ball held.  Screen for dungeon.  Random path to Dragon Boss, 4 different rooms
    Use flippers / activate to pick path
    Standard: Goblins, # determined by difficulty.  Roll 1d20 > than number to defeat, others fail.  Sword power used automatically (add to roll)
    Wizard Room: Fireball melts ice
    Ranger Room: Arrows release ropes / bridge
    Rogue Room: Traps are disarmed
    Dragon Room:  Fight dragon.  Each dragon defeat at +1 x multiplier at end of game for score
                  Any party members come out as multiball.
                  Ramp / path opens to dragon - hit the target to defeat
