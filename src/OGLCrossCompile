how can I cross compile on OGL ES app for raspberry pi 5 in 64 bit windows? Give me a full example with header and library setup

Sure! Here's a step-by-step guide to cross-compile an OpenGL ES application for your Raspberry Pi 5 on a Windows PC:

Step 1: Set Up Your Development Environment
Install the ARM GNU Toolchain:

Download the ARM GNU Toolchain for AArch64 GNU/Linux target from the ARM Developer website.

Install the toolchain by running the downloaded executable (arm-gnu-toolchain-14.2.rel1-mingw-w64-x86_64-aarch64-none-linux-gnu.exe).

Install Visual Studio Code:

Download and install Visual Studio Code (VS Code) on your Windows PC.

Install the Remote - SSH extension in VS Code.

Step 2: Write Your OpenGL ES Application
Create a New File:

Open VS Code and create a new file named main.cpp.

Write the Code:

Copy and paste the following OpenGL ES code into main.cpp:

cpp
#include <EGL/egl.h>
#include <GLES2/gl2.h>
#include <iostream>

int main() {
    // Initialize EGL
    EGLDisplay display = eglGetDisplay(EGL_DEFAULT_DISPLAY);
    eglInitialize(display, nullptr, nullptr);

    // Choose an EGL config
    EGLConfig config;
    EGLint numConfigs;
    EGLint configAttribs[] = {
        EGL_SURFACE_TYPE, EGL_PBUFFER_BIT,
        EGL_BLUE_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_GREEN_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_RED_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_DEPTH_SIZE, 8,
        EGL_RENDERABLE_TYPE, EGL_OPENGL_ES2_BIT,
        EGL_NONE
    };
    eglChooseConfig(display, configAttribs, &config, 1, &numConfigs);

    // Create an EGL context
    EGLint contextAttribs[] = { EGL_CONTEXT_CLIENT_VERSION, 2, EGL_NONE };
    EGLContext context = eglCreateContext(display, config, EGL_NO_CONTEXT, contextAttribs);

    // Create an EGL surface
    EGLint surfaceAttribs[] = { EGL_WIDTH, 640, EGL_HEIGHT, 480, EGL_NONE };
    EGLSurface surface = eglCreatePbufferSurface(display, config, surfaceAttribs);

    // Make the context current
    eglMakeCurrent(display, surface, surface, context);

    // Clear the screen
    glClearColor(0.0f, 0.0f, 1.0f, 1.0f);
    glClear(GL_COLOR_BUFFER_BIT);

    // Swap buffers
    eglSwapBuffers(display, surface);

    // Terminate EGL
    eglDestroySurface(display, surface);
    eglDestroyContext(display, context);
    eglTerminate(display);

    std::cout << "OpenGL ES application ran successfully!" << std::endl;
    return 0;
}
Save the File.

Step 3: Set Up OpenGL ES Headers and Libraries
Download OpenGL ES Headers:

Download the OpenGL ES headers from the Khronos Group.

Extract the headers to a directory, for example, C:\OpenGL-ES-Headers.

Set Up OpenGL ES Libraries:

On your Raspberry Pi, install the OpenGL ES libraries:

sh
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y libgles2-mesa-dev
Copy the libraries from your Raspberry Pi to your Windows PC. You can find them in /usr/lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/ and /opt/vc/lib/.

Step 4: Cross-Compile the Application
Open a Terminal in VS Code:

Navigate to the directory where you saved main.cpp.

Compile the Code:

Use the following command to compile your program:

sh
aarch64-none-linux-gnu-g++.exe -I C:\OpenGL-ES-Headers -L path/to/libraries -o main main.cpp -lGLESv2 -lEGL
Replace path/to/libraries with the path to the OpenGL ES libraries you copied from your Raspberry Pi.

Step 5: Transfer and Run the Application on Raspberry Pi
Transfer the Compiled Program:

Use SCP or another method to transfer the compiled program (main) to your Raspberry Pi.

Run the Program:

Execute the following commands on your Raspberry Pi:

sh
chmod +x main
./main
This setup should allow you to cross-compile and run an OpenGL ES application for your Raspberry Pi 5 from your Windows PC.

To develop OpenGL ES 3.1 applications, you'll need several libraries. Here are the key ones:

1. **libGLESv2**: This library provides the core OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.1 functionality.
2. **libEGL**: This library is used for creating and managing OpenGL ES contexts and surfaces.
3. **libGL**: This library provides the core OpenGL functionality, which is sometimes needed for compatibility.
4. **libGLU**: This library provides the OpenGL Utility Library, which includes higher-level drawing routines.
5. **libglut**: This library provides the OpenGL Utility Toolkit, which is useful for creating windows and handling input.

On your Raspberry Pi, you can install these libraries using the following command:
```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libgles2-mesa-dev libegl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-dev libglu1-mesa-dev freeglut3-dev
```

This command will install the necessary development files for OpenGL ES 3.1, EGL, and other related libraries.

libGLESv2: This library provides the core OpenGL ES 2.0 and 3.1 functionality.
