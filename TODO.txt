This file tracks the various items to do in the pinball project in rough priority

Create all the basic state screens (but probably on just basic score for the play screen - that one will be extensive)
Create basic score screen
Create automatic sprite animation - starting place, stoping place, time to animate (use standard sprite instance stuff?) 
Create input / output message processing
Change sprite X/Y input to allow negatives, since really you can start rendering offscreen since it's just 3D
Architecture a new thread system - what gameplay, rendering, etc.. elements need their own threads?  Right now it's single threaded...
Create sound output queue system
Set up OGL ES code to work w/ PiOS libs / headers
Set up VS Code to cross compile for PiOS
Install git LFS as that large bitmaps, etc.. are expected at some point
Expand sprites to have animated sprites - eg: UV maps within a sprite with different images - base is there but need example to integrate.
    -  Is there some standard sprite format / program that can be used?
Update all render screens to be independent from screen size, use more #defines to adjust screens more quickly when needed
Duplicate all the Windows simulation capability in PiOS
Save settings info in a file and restore from a file
Create functions for auto text shadowing and centering full text rendering
