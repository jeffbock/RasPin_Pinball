This file tracks the various items to do in the pinball project in rough priority

Create all the basic state screens (but probably on just basic score for the play screen - that one will be extensive)
Create basic score screen
Create test screen listing items and then activating them through the flipper buttons
Create input / output and sound queue sytems
Set up OGL ES code to work w/ PiOS libs / headers
Set up VS Code to cross compile for PiOS
Duplicate all the Windows simulation capability in PiOS
Install git LFS as that large bitmaps, etc.. are expected at some point
Expand sprites to have animated sprites - eg: UV maps within a sprite with different images - base is there but need example to integrate.
    -  Is there some standard sprite format / program that can be used?
Change sprite X/Y input to allow negatives, since really you can start rendering offscreen since it's just 3D
Architecture a new thread system - what gameplay, rendering, etc.. elements need their own threads?  Right now it's single threaded...
