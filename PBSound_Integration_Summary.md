# PBSound Integration Summary

## What Has Been Created

I have successfully created a complete audio system for the PInball project with the following components:

### Files Created:

1. **`src/PBSound.h`** - Header file with class definition
2. **`src/PBSound.cpp`** - Implementation file with SDL_mixer integration
3. **`src/PBSoundExample.cpp`** - Usage examples and demonstrations
4. **`PBSound_README.md`** - Comprehensive documentation

### Files Modified:

1. **`src/PInball.h`** - Added PBSound include and member variable to PBEngine
2. **`src/PInball.cpp`** - Added sound system initialization for both Windows and Raspberry Pi
3. **`.vscode/tasks.json`** - Updated build tasks to include PBSound.cpp and SDL libraries

## PBSound Class Features

### Core Functionality:
- **Cross-platform compatibility**: Compiles on Windows (stub) and Raspberry Pi (full functionality)
- **Background music**: Loop MP3 files using `pbsPlayMusic()`
- **Sound effects**: Play up to 4 simultaneous effects with `pbsPlayEffect()`
- **Volume control**: Separate master and music volume controls (0-100%)
- **Effect management**: Query effect status and stop individual effects

### Key Methods:

```cpp
// Initialization
bool initialize();                              // Initialize SDL and audio system
void shutdown();                               // Cleanup (automatic in destructor)

// Music control
bool pbsPlayMusic(const std::string& mp3);    // Play looping background music
void stopMusic();                              // Stop current music

// Sound effects (returns effect ID 1-4, or 0 on failure)
int pbsPlayEffect(const std::string& mp3);    // Play effect once
bool isEffectPlaying(int effectId);           // Check if effect is still playing
void stopEffect(int effectId);               // Stop specific effect
void stopAllEffects();                       // Stop all effects

// Volume control (0-100%)
void setMasterVolume(int volume);             // Set overall volume
void setMusicVolume(int volume);              // Set music volume
int getMasterVolume() const;                  // Get current master volume
int getMusicVolume() const;                   // Get current music volume
```

## Integration with PInball Engine

The PBSound class has been integrated into the main PBEngine class:

1. **Header integration**: Added `#include "PBSound.h"` to `PInball.h`
2. **Member variable**: Added `PBSound m_soundSystem;` to PBEngine class
3. **Initialization**: Sound system initializes during graphics setup on both platforms
4. **Build system**: Updated tasks.json to include PBSound.cpp and SDL libraries

## Usage in PInball Game

You can now use the sound system anywhere in the PInball code like this:

```cpp
// Play background music
g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.pbsPlayMusic("src/resources/audio/background.mp3");

// Play sound effects
int shootEffect = g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.pbsPlayEffect("src/resources/audio/shoot.mp3");
int hitEffect = g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.pbsPlayEffect("src/resources/audio/hit.mp3");

// Control volumes
g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.setMasterVolume(80);  // 80% master volume
g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.setMusicVolume(60);   // 60% music volume

// Check if effects are still playing
if (g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.isEffectPlaying(shootEffect)) {
    // Effect is still playing
}

// Stop specific effects
g_PBEngine.m_soundSystem.stopEffect(shootEffect);
```

## Platform-Specific Behavior

### Raspberry Pi 5 (EXE_MODE_RASPI):
- Full SDL_mixer functionality
- 44.1kHz, 16-bit stereo audio
- Up to 4 simultaneous sound effects
- MP3 file support for music and effects
- Automatic audio format conversion
- Effect caching for performance

### Windows (EXE_MODE_WINDOWS):
- Stub implementation for compilation compatibility
- All functions return false/0 but don't crash
- Allows development and testing on Windows

## Installation Requirements

### For Raspberry Pi 5:
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-mixer-dev
```

### Build Configuration:
Switch between platforms by modifying `PBBuildSwitch.h`:

For Raspberry Pi:
```cpp
// #define EXE_MODE_WINDOWS
#define EXE_MODE_RASPI
```

For Windows:
```cpp
#define EXE_MODE_WINDOWS
// #define EXE_MODE_RASPI
```

## Audio Format Specifications

The system uses optimized settings for good quality with reasonable memory usage:
- **Sample Rate**: 44.1 kHz
- **Format**: 16-bit signed
- **Channels**: Stereo
- **Buffer Size**: 1024 bytes

## Performance Considerations

1. **Effect Caching**: Sound effects are automatically cached for reuse
2. **Music Streaming**: Music files are streamed, not fully loaded into memory
3. **Slot Management**: Maximum of 4 simultaneous effects prevents memory overload
4. **Automatic Cleanup**: Sound system cleans up automatically when PBEngine destructs

## Error Handling

- All functions return appropriate success/failure indicators
- Windows stub implementation prevents crashes during development
- SDL errors are handled gracefully
- File loading failures return appropriate error codes

## Next Steps

To fully integrate audio into your pinball game:

1. **Add audio files**: Create `src/resources/audio/` directory with your MP3 files
2. **Game events**: Add sound triggers to game events (ball hits, scoring, etc.)
3. **Menu sounds**: Add audio feedback to menu navigation
4. **Volume settings**: Integrate volume controls into the settings menu
5. **Audio assets**: Record or obtain pinball-appropriate sound effects and music

The PBSound system is now ready to use and will provide high-quality audio playback for your pinball machine on Raspberry Pi 5 while maintaining compatibility for Windows development.
