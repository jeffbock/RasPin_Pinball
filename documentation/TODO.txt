This file tracks the various items to do in the pinball project in rough priority

** Raspberry Pi Specific Work
None

** Generic arch improvements
None

** Gameplay tasks - will evolve as HW becomes more capable
Add dungeon exploring and combat screens 
Really make the game

** Hardware enabling
Create prototype cabinet
Design prototype HW, use test mode to enable
    * Flippers, Sligshots, Pop Bumpers, Lane / Ball Detectors, Multiball lock gate
    * Build proto cabinet w/ foam board
Build relay output boards that connect to output IO chips.  Likely FET controlled, opto-isolated and support multiple voltage output ranges
    * Put the scematics for all boards into DigiKey for documenting.  See how much cost to build for real?
Add fuses to protect HW / boards
Add capapacitors to I/O boards for noise reduction, solenoid surge protection

** Lower Priority
Refactor redudant input messages (output messages now not type (eg: flipper) specific) - do same for inputs?
Bug: Debug why u1 and u2 and x1 and x2 seem to be swapped when going from screen to 3D space.  Maybe rendering backface polys
Protect input / output queues with mutex and make them multi-thread?  Doesn't seem to be needed with current design
Expand sprites to have animated sprites - eg: UV maps within a sprite with different images - base is there but need example to integrate.
    -  Is there some standard sprite format / program that can be used?
    -  Or add basic capability to animate more automatically between different sprites / loop / etc..
Expand 3D models to support skeleton / animation
Actually checkout the CMAKE flow - I don't use it a lot right now

** Maybe future stuff
The way 3D was integrated breaks some of the architectural goals, may not be worth fixing for a theoretical back end change at some point.
